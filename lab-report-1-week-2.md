## Trying Some Commands
>![Image](./TryingSomeCommands.png)
>I tried the following commands:
```
1. cd      - this did nothing
2. cd ~    - this changes the directory to the default root directly
3. ls -lat - unknown
4. ls -a   - shows all files including hidden ones in the directory, the green are the the hidden files/directories, and the blue are the directories
```
